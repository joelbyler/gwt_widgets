## Contribute

* Fork the project.
* Test drive your feature addition or bug fix. Adding specs is important and I will not accept a pull request that does not have tests.
* Make sure you describe your new feature with a cucumber scenario.
* Make sure you provide RDoc comments for any new public method you add. Remember, others will be using this gem.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or ChangeLog.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
